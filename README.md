# Advancing-LLMs-in-Financial-Regulatory-Understanding

This project fine-tunes the LLaMA model to understand and generate content specific to financial regulations. It uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA to reduce training time and resource use.

## Project Goals
- Fine-tune LLaMA for financial regulatory text using real datasets (e.g., FDIC, SEC).
- Use evaluation metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore to assess model quality.
- Support applications in compliance automation and regulatory understanding.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuning with LoRA (PEFT) for efficiency.
- Data preprocessing: tokenization, normalization, synonym replacement.
- Inference pipeline for generating definitions or explanations from queries.
- Evaluation using ROUGE and BERTScore.
